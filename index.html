<p>I am a professor of computer science at the University of Virginia
(view my <a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~asb">home page</a>). This
site contains web pages for my various course repositories available
online. Note that some are outdated, while others are current. Most of
the sites lined to below are released under a <a
href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons
Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a> (CC BY-SA), but
check each individual site’s license for complete details.</p>
<p>Currently updated sites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="pdr/">pdr</a>: the course site for a UVA course entitled
“Program and Data Representation” – a CS 3 course in C++ for 2nd year
students – from the <a
href="https://github.com/uva-cs/pdr">uva-cs/pdr</a> repo. My personal
copy of that repo (aaronbloomfield/pdr) is no longer being updated, but
the uva-cs/pdr fork is being updated throughout the 2018-2019 academic
year.</li>
<li><a href="ccc/">ccc</a>: a 4th year course on Cryptocurrency. It is
being offered in the spring of 2022, and the content is being filled in
during that time.</li>
<li><a href="ics/">ics</a>: the course site for a Introduction to
Cybersecurity course, from the<a
href="https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/ics">aaronbloomfield/ics</a>
repo. Although the course is still being taught, I am not teaching it,
so one should look elsewhere for the current semester’s iteration of the
course.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sites not being currently updated:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="slp/">slp</a>: the course site for a 4th year two semester
software engineering capstone course from the <a
href="https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/slp">aaronbloomfield/slp</a>
repo. I am no longer teaching this course as of the spring of 2018, so
this repo is no longer being updated.</li>
<li><a href="dada/">dada</a>: the course site for a cybersecurity
elective, entitled Defense Against the Dark Arts, focusing on binary
exploits, from the <a
href="https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/dada">aaronbloomfield/dada</a>
repo. This course is still being taught at UVA, but by other
instructors.</li>
<li><a href="hspc/">hspc</a>: the start of a repo on how to run high
school programming contests, from the <a
href="https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/hspc">aaronbloomfield/hspc</a>
repo. This was created for the SIGCSE 2018 workshop entitled,
“Organizing a High School Programming Contest” is here.</li>
</ul>
<!--

The various utilities herein -- which you can see from the[github view of this
repo](https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/aaronbloomfield.github.io)
-- are used to update the site.  This repo has multiple sub-modules,
and when each one receives a push, a webhook is called
([git-to-github-io.php](git-to-github-io.php.html)); that runs the
[git-to-github-io](git-to-github-io.html) bash shell script, which
pulls this repo and all it's sub-modules, and then commits any changes.
This forces a change to the sub-modules on the github.io site.  Note
that the webhook should be set up to run for each of the sub-modules,
as well as the github.io site itself.  Sub-modules of sub-modules are
also properly updated via this script (although none currently exist).
