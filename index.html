<p>I am a professor of computer science at the University of Virginia (view my <a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~asb">home page</a>). This site contains web pages for the various repos that I want to make available online. Note that some are outdated, while others are current. Most of the sites lined to below are released under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a> (CC BY-SA), but check each individual site's license for complete details.</p>
<p>Currently updated sites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="pdr/">pdr</a>: the course site for a UVa course entitled &quot;Program and Data Representation&quot; -- a CS 3 course in C++ for 2nd year students -- from the <a href="https://github.com/uva-cs/pdr">uva-cs/pdr</a> repo. My personal copy of that repo (aaronbloomfield/pdr) is no longer being updated, but the uva-cs/pdr fork is being updated throughout the 2018-2019 academic year.</li>
<li><a href="ics/">ics</a>: the course site for a Introduction to Cybersecurity course, from the <a href="https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/ics">aaronbloomfield/ics</a> repo. This course is being taught for the first time at UVa in the fall of 2018, so the course content will be filled in throughout the fall 2018 semester.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sites not being currently updated:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="slp/">slp</a>: the course site for a 4th year two semester software engineering capstone course from the <a href="https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/slp">aaronbloomfield/slp</a> repo. I am no longer teaching this course as of the spring of 2018, so this repo is no longer being updated.</li>
<li><a href="dada/">dada</a>: the course site for a cybersecurity elective, entitled Defense Against the Dark Arts, focusing on binary exploits, from the <a href="https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/dada">aaronbloomfield/dada</a> repo. This course is still being taught at UVa, but by other instructors.</li>
<li><a href="hspc/">hspc</a>: the start of a repo on how to run high school programming contests, from the <a href="https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/hspc">aaronbloomfield/hspc</a> repo. This was created for the SIGCSE 2018 workshop entitled, &quot;Organizing a High School Programming Contest&quot; is here.</li>
</ul>
<p>The various utilities herein -- which you can see from the <a href="https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/aaronbloomfield.github.io">github view of this repo</a> -- are used to update the site. This repo has multiple sub-modules, and when each one receives a push, a webhook is called (<a href="git-to-github-io.php.html">git-to-github-io.php</a>); that runs the <a href="git-to-github-io.html">git-to-github-io</a> bash shell script, which pulls this repo and all it's sub-modules, and then commits any changes. This forces a change to the sub-modules on the github.io site. Note that the webhook should be set up to run for each of the sub-modules, as well as the github.io site itself. Sub-modules of sub-modules are also properly updated via this script (although none currently exist).</p>
